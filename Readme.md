# Voice-to-Voice Assistant Components
This repository contains elements that can be integrated as a voice-to-voice assistant.

## Pointer
Pointer enforces selection among predefined options.

Functionality: Utilizes a Weaviate database containing a list of databases, descriptive paragraphs, and few-shot examples to guide selection.
Purpose: Enables querying across multiple databases with differing data headers, preserving the integrity and format of publicly available datasets.
Use Case: For instance, when a user in Sacramento seeks shelter, Pointer directs the query to the appropriate database containing social service information.

## LiveKit Cloud Voice Assistant
LiveKit offers backend support for Large Language Model (LLM) interactions.

Workflow: Converts voice input to text, processes it through an LLM, and then converts the response back to speech.
Latency: While there is noticeable latency, integrating the OpenAI Realtime API can mitigate this issue.
Monitoring: Features an open-source console for auditing conversations, ensuring quality and appropriatenessâ€”ideal for personal LLMs where unsupervised user monitoring is crucial.
To run the application:

bash
Copy code
cd VoiceAssistant
python Talk.py start


## OpenAI-Realtime-py
This module is a cloned GitHub repository implementing OpenAI Realtime.

Interface: Operates via the console without requiring a graphical user interface, making it suitable for deployments without a display.
Logging: Integration of logging functionality is recommended.
Integration: Compatible with the LiveKit script, enhancing its utility.
Streamlit Deploy
A straightforward deployment script for Streamlit applications.

Enhancement: Future development aims to incorporate audio input/output capabilities.
